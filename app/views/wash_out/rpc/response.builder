# This view was taken from WashOut directly (https://github.com/inossidabile/wash_out/blob/master/app/views/wash_out/rpc/response.builder)
# then modified to fit the specific RPC SOAP response OnCore requires to work with SPARC.
# There was no way to include a MessageId element with an xmlns element and a value within the element,
# so the proper format was forced in this view.
